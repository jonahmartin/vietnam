    <h1 class="contenttitle">The History of Vietnam</h1>
    <p>
    The history of Vietnam can be traced back as early as the Paleolithic age. Their cultural influence on much of southeast Asia was great. 
    From the first millennium BC until 939 AD, Vietnam existed under Chinese rule, gaining their independence during an uprising against China. 
    This millennia spent under Chinese influence had a significant effect on Vietnamese traditions and culture. Much of Confucianism and Buddhist 
    teachings were incorporated into the cultural zeitgeist of Vietnam. So much so, that Mahayana Buddhism quickly became the state religion of Vietnam. 
	Vietnam experienced centuries of war and shifting borders during the Middle Ages. In-fighting and political turmoil were constant dangers during 
    the Middle Ages. Later, during the era of colonialism, France, with the help of Spain, invaded and conquered Vietnam and much of southeast Asia, 
    renaming it French Indochina. During this time, France restructured Vietnam’s socio-economic policies to most benefit French business, primarily 
    becoming an export economy built around dyes, tobacco, and teas. There was an attempt made by France to erase Vietnam’s traditions and culture, 
    replacing them with their own religious beliefs and social philosophy, much like what occurred in the America’s during the same period.

    <p> 
    During the Second World War, Japan invaded the mainland of Asia, taking joint control of the area with Vichy France. In this time of upheaval 
    and war, American attacks on trade in the area and the occupation led to a famine which killed an estimated 2 million people. Following the war, 
    Vietnam was divided up into two states: North Vietnam and South Vietnam. After a fraudulent referendum in South Vietnam supported by the USA and 
    France, lines were drawn between North and South Vietnam, with the north receiving support from the USSR.
    As tensions flared, North Vietnam began instituting rent and land reform laws, as well as participating in political executions of French colonists 
    and supporters of the colonial regime. In response, South Vietnam detained anyone suspected of having any amount of communist beliefs and placed them 
    into “political re-education” camps. These events, as well as violent government crackdowns on non-Christian demonstrations against the state religion, 
    would fuel the fires of the Vietnam War. After the USA’s defeat in the Vietnam War, North and South Vietnam were merged into a single state known as 
    the Socialist Republic of Vietnam. The following decades consisted of rebuilding and economic reforms.

      and has become a folk legend in Vietnam for resistance against foreign threats. she is quoted as saying "I'd like to ride storms, 
      kill orcas in the open sea, drive out the aggressors, reconquer the country, undo the ties of serfdom, and never bend my back to be the concubine of whatever man."

  <p>
    Ho Chi Minh was a revolutionary and the leader of Vietnam from 1945 until 1965 when his health declined. The former capital of South Vietnam was renamed Ho Chi Minh City in his honour after his death in 1969.
    Often called by the nickname Uncle Ho, Minh is a beloved figure throughout Vietnam, and regarded as one of their greatest leaders. He spent much of his time in power inspiring others throughout the world in 
    the efforts of decolonization and liberation. Minh devoted his life to the liberation of Vietnam and aiding those who found themselves in similar conditions.
